# fitts-law

A few notes:
+ This project contains a lot of leftover junk code from my last semester project.
+ The current working scene is **Scenes > FittsLaw > 01 - Basic Events** I think.
+ Currently using **Unity 2017.1.1f1**. You should be able to download this from Unity website.

Building:
+ File > Build Settings
+ Make sure Universal Windows Platform is selected, with HoloLens as target
+ If you have problems when building, it might because you need to download the most up to date Windows SDK
+ Build it
+ Open Visual Studio File
+ Plug in Hololens
+ Change Debug > Release
+ Change ARM > x86
+ Change Local Machine > Device
+ Hit green build arrow
